🚀 Executive Summary

This project delivers an end-to-end analysis of customer shopping behavior using 3,900 real-world transactional records.
It demonstrates my ability to translate raw data into business decisions through structured analysis, SQL-driven insights, and executive dashboards.

The workflow mirrors how analytics teams operate in production environments:

Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering → SQL Analysis → Visualization → Business Recommendations

🎯 Business Objectives

Identify high-value customer segments

Measure the impact of discounts and subscriptions on revenue

Understand product performance and customer preferences

Enable data-driven marketing and retention strategies


📊 Dataset Overview

Records: 3,900 customer purchases

Attributes: 18 columns

Key Dimensions

Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location)

Purchase details (Category, Amount, Season)

Behavioral metrics (Discount usage, Reviews, Subscriptions)

Data Quality Handling

37 missing values in review_rating

Imputed using median rating by product category

Columns standardized using snake_case

🐍 Python: Data Preparation & Feature Engineering
Key Highlights

Robust data validation and null handling

Feature engineering for business segmentation:

age_group

purchase_frequency_days

Removal of redundant fields after logical consistency checks

Production-style export of clean data to SQL database

Outcome: A clean, analysis-ready dataset optimized for SQL querying and BI visualization.

🗄️ SQL: Business-Driven Analysis

I designed SQL queries to directly answer real stakeholder questions, including:

Revenue contribution by gender

Discount users with above-average spending

Top-rated products by customer reviews

Shipping method impact on order value

Subscriber vs non-subscriber revenue comparison

Products most dependent on discounts

Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)

Top products within each category

Repeat buyers vs subscription adoption

Revenue distribution across age groups

Queries are written using window functions, CTEs, conditional logic, and aggregations.

📈 Power BI: Executive Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was built to enable:

Revenue and customer segmentation analysis

Product and category performance tracking

Subscription and discount impact evaluation
